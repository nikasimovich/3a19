### Homework

- Spend at least 2 to 3 hours working on Project 2.
- Start with refining your idea based on today&rsquo;s feedback and extending your research and figuring out your content. Create a written outline (google doc, paper doc) with ideas for the content of your site. Be sure to organize it into different sections, you&rsquo;ll continue adding to it as you develop the project. You can consider this a blueprint for the site you&rsquo;re going to create – consider all the different pages you&rsquo;ll need, then you can translate this into a loose wireframe before you begin designing.
- Come to class with an initial mock up of your website in Figma/Sketch. You should have at least 3 different sections sketched out with a high level of fidelity.
- Read [Visible Wisdom – Muriel Cooper](http://fall2019-3a.designforthe.net/content/7-library/26-visible-wisdom/visible-wisdom_murielcooper.pdf) and connect a discussion question to the are.na readings board
